# chrome-shrug
Chrome extension that creates a context menu item to insert a shrug ascii emoticon ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

# installation
Download the files, open the extension manager and add it as an unpacked extension. Easy!

# known issues
- Currently working only on inputs, textareas and tags with the "contenteditable" attribute.
- It doesn't trigger any keypressed-like event, so sometimes you need to type after the insertion to trigger the regular behaviour for the field.
